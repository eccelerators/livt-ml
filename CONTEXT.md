# Livt Agent Context

This file is a project-agnostic, self-contained handoff for agent sessions
working with Livt projects. It covers the Livt language, conventions, build
workflow, and practical style. Keep project-specific goals, component lists,
and milestone status in a repository `AGENTS.md` or `README.md`; keep detailed
compiler failures in `COMPILER.md`.

## What Livt Is

Livt is a programming language for describing FPGA/HDL-oriented behavior with a
software-like component structure. A Livt project usually contains components,
interfaces, functions, processes, tests, and generated VHDL output.

Common use cases:

- hardware application logic
- reusable protocol or peripheral components
- small fixed-function FPGA applications
- tests that compile to VHDL simulations

The goal is not to hide hardware. Good FPGA work still requires clear thinking
about timing, state, signals, reset behavior, and resource usage. Livt raises
the level at which you express that hardware, so more of your attention can go
into the design itself instead of repeated HDL boilerplate.

## Project Files

Typical files:

- `livt.toml`: project configuration, source root, output directory, tests,
  dependencies.
- `src/**/*.lvt`: source components. Files may be flat or grouped in
  subdirectories; namespaces define the logical API.
- `tests/**/*.lvt`: Livt test components.
- `.livt/deps/`: synchronized dependencies.
- `out/`: generated build output.
- `COMPILER.md`: project-local notes about compiler or VHDL generation issues.
- `README.md` or `AGENTS.md`: project-local goals, architecture, API shape,
  status, and human-facing usage.
- `README.md`: human-facing overview and usage.

For agent handoffs:

- Use this `CONTEXT.md` for reusable Livt knowledge.
- Use `README.md` or `AGENTS.md` for project-specific continuation instructions.
- Use `COMPILER.md` only for reproducible current compiler/generation bugs and
  local workarounds. Remove stale warnings once the compiler or verification
  suite proves a pattern is supported.

## Comment Style

Follow the Livt comment style from `livt-book/DESIGN_GUIDE.md`.

Use full aligned `/** */` doc comments immediately before component
declarations, constructors (`new()`), functions, and process declarations, even
when the comment is a single sentence:

```livt
/**
 * Resets the accumulator to zero.
 */
public fn Reset()
```

Use `//` comments for fields, constants, and short inline implementation notes:

```livt
// Maximum signed 16-bit accumulator value.
public const ACC_MAX: int = 32767
```

Prefer self-documenting names over comments that merely explain what the code
does. A comment should usually explain API contracts, ranges, timing
assumptions, byte layouts, or why a non-obvious design choice exists. For
byte-builder functions, include the byte-range layout in the `/** */` comment.

## Basic Livt Shape

### Namespaces

A namespace groups related declarations and prevents name collisions:

```livt
namespace Example.Project
```

Everything declared in that file belongs to `Example.Project`. A file can import
another namespace with `using`:

```livt
namespace Example.Project.Tests

using Example.Project
```

After the `using`, code in `Example.Project.Tests` can refer to components from
`Example.Project` by their short names.

File-scoped and block-scoped namespace forms are both used in verified projects:

```livt
namespace Example.Project;

component A
{
}
```

```livt
namespace Example.Project
{
	component A
	{
	}
}
```

Semicolons are accepted as statement separators in many examples, but the book
style generally omits them. Follow the surrounding project style.

### Components

A component is the main unit of Livt design. It is similar to a hardware module:
it can hold state, expose public behavior, connect to other components, and
generate VHDL.

```livt
namespace Example.Project

component ByteReader
{
	public const OFFSET: int = 14

	public fn GetByte(frame: byte[128], index: int) byte
	{
		if (index == 0) {
			return frame[OFFSET]
		}

		return 0x00
	}
}
```

A component should represent a meaningful design boundary, not a single
primitive operation. Good component names describe a role: `PacketParser`,
`ChecksumVerifier`, `RegisterBank`, `UartTransmitter`.

### Classes and Static Functions

A `class` is a named container for `public static fn` and
`public static inline fn` helpers. Unlike a `component`, a `class` has no
state, no constructor, no fields, and no run/busy dispatcher. It exists solely
to group pure combinatorial functions under a shared namespace.

```livt
namespace Livt.Crypto.Internal

class GfMath
{
    public static inline fn Mul2(a: byte) byte
    {
        var aInt: int = a as int
        var doubled: int = aInt * 2
        if (aInt >= 128)
        {
            var low8: int = doubled - 256
            return (low8 as byte) ^ 0x1b
        }
        return doubled as byte
    }

    public static inline fn Mul3(a: byte) byte
    {
        var m2: byte = GfMath.Mul2(a)
        return m2 ^ a
    }
}
```

Static methods are called with the class name as the receiver — no `this.`,
no instance, no dispatcher overhead:

```livt
var b2: byte = GfMath.Mul2(b)
var b3: byte = GfMath.Mul3(b)
```

#### `inline` and `static` are orthogonal

`inline` answers *how is this compiled* (emit as a VHDL combinatorial
`function`, no run/busy FSM). `static` answers *how is this called* (as
`TypeName.Method(args)`, no instance needed). They are independent and can
be combined:

| Declaration | Container | Call site | VHDL emission |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| `fn Foo()` | component | `this.Foo()` | FSM dispatcher in architecture |
| `inline fn Foo()` | component | `this.Foo()` | Combinatorial `function` in architecture declaration region |
| `public static fn Foo()` | class | `MyClass.Foo()` | `function` in namespace package |
| `public static inline fn Foo()` | class | `MyClass.Foo()` | `function` in namespace package (with purity constraint) |

For `static` methods, `inline` and non-`inline` produce identical VHDL — a
package function is always combinatorial. The `inline` modifier on a `static fn`
serves as an explicit purity annotation: no `state {}` blocks, no `this.*`
reads or writes, pure combinatorial only.

#### `inline fn` inside a component

An `inline fn` declared inside a `component` is emitted as a VHDL
`function` in the architecture's declaration region and called directly with
no run/busy dispatcher. Same-component calls have zero dispatch overhead:

```livt
component EncryptBlock128
{
    const SBOX_Q0: byte[64] = [ ... ]

    inline fn SBoxFwd(b: byte) byte
    {
        var idx: int = b as int
        if (idx < 64) { return this.SBOX_Q0[idx] }
        ...
    }

    // Called as this.SBoxFwd(x) — zero dispatcher overhead
}
```

**Constraint**: `inline fn` only eliminates overhead for *same-component*
calls. Calling `this.sub.InlineMethod(x)` from a parent component still goes
through the normal component-call dispatcher.

Use component `inline fn` for pure helpers that return a value. Until the local
compiler notes say otherwise, avoid void `inline fn` procedures that mutate
component fields, especially array fields or code that calls class static
helpers. Use a plain `fn` with `state {}` blocks for those in-place operations.

### Fields

Fields are values owned by a component. A field without `public` is private:

```livt
component PacketStatistics
{
	acceptedCount: int
	droppedCount: int

	public fn Accept()
	{
		this.acceptedCount = this.acceptedCount + 1
	}
}
```

A public field without a direction is a stored public value — state owned by the
component that callers can read directly:

```livt
public acceptedCount: int
```

A public field with `in` or `out` is a signal field — a hardware port:

```livt
public valid: in logic     // driven by the caller, read by this component
public ready: out logic    // driven by this component, read by the caller
```

Use signal fields at hardware boundaries. Use stored fields for internal state
and observable values.

### Constants

Constants are named values that do not change. Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`:

```livt
public const OFFSET: int = 14
public const MAX_BUFFER_SIZE: int = 256
public const MAGIC_HEADER: byte[2] = [0xDE, 0xAD]
```

Constants can be private or public. A public constant is part of the component's
API. Constants can also hold fixed-size data:

```livt
public const CRLF: byte[2] = [0x0D, 0x0A]
public const OK: byte[] = "OK".Encode()
```

### Constructors

A constructor describes how a component is created and wired:

```livt
component StatusOutput
{
	enabled: logic
	public active: out logic

	new(enabled: logic, active: out logic)
	{
		this.enabled = enabled
		active = this.active
	}
}
```

Constructors should wire subcomponents and record input bindings. They should
not contain complex logic. Keep them short.

Constructor parameters are how components connect to the outside world and to
each other. Top-level components should keep constructor parameters flat and
primitive, then pass those signals into subcomponents through their constructors.
Output constructor parameters can be forwarded to a child constructor, so a
composition root can expose FPGA pins while the child owns the actual driver
fields:

```livt
component Top
{
	device: Device

	new(a: logic, y: out logic)
	{
		this.device = new Device(a, y)
	}
}
```

### Subcomponents

A component can own another component as a field and instantiate it in the
constructor:

```livt
component PacketPipeline
{
	stats: PacketStatistics

	new()
	{
		this.stats = new PacketStatistics()
	}

	public fn AcceptPacket()
	{
		this.stats.Accept()
	}
}
```

This is composition. Larger systems are built by wiring smaller components
together.

Constructors may also call methods on subcomponents after instantiation. The
compiler generates a startup sequence that runs after reset and before ordinary
process behavior:

```livt
component AccumulatorInit
{
	acc: Accumulator

	new()
	{
		this.acc = new Accumulator()
		this.acc.Add(10)
		this.acc.Add(5)
	}
}
```

Keep constructor calls short and deterministic. For heavier computed
initialization, prefer an explicit startup function and call it from a process
or test, as described later in this file.

### Functions And Parameters

Functions are private by default. You may write `private fn` explicitly, but it
is not required. Add `public` when the function is part of the component API:

```livt
fn IsUpperHex(value: byte) bool
{
	return value >= 0x41 && value <= 0x46
}

public fn IsHexDigit(value: byte) bool
{
	if (value >= 0x30 && value <= 0x39)
	{
		return true
	}
	return this.IsUpperHex(value)
}
```

A function with no return type performs an action:

```livt
public fn Reset()
{
	this.count = 0
}
```

Parameters are inputs by default. You may also write `in` explicitly. Use `out`
when the function writes a value back to the caller, and `inout` only when the
function genuinely needs to read and write the same caller-provided value:

```livt
public fn TryPop(value: out byte) bool
{
	value = 0x00
	return false
}
```

### Processes

Processes describe ongoing behavior. A process runs repeatedly and is part of
the component's hardware behavior.

A process with empty brackets is combinational:

```livt
process Update[]()
{
	this.transfer = this.valid & this.ready
}
```

A process without empty brackets uses the component's context (clock and reset)
and is sequential:

```livt
process Count()
{
	this.count = this.count + 1
}
```

Every component has a context for sequential behavior. When a component receives
clock and reset signals explicitly, bind them in the constructor:

```livt
new(clk: clock, rst: reset)
{
	this.context.clk = clk
	this.context.rst = rst
}
```

### Application-Style Process Loop

In Livt, an application "loop" is commonly expressed as a `process Main()` that
runs continuously in hardware. It should check whether input is available and
`continue` when there is no work:

```livt
namespace Example.App

component PollingApp
{
	device: Device

	new(rx: in logic, tx: out logic)
	{
		this.device = new Device(rx, tx)
	}

	process Main()
	{
		if (!this.device.IsDataAvailable())
		{
			continue
		}

		var data = this.device.Receive()

		// Decode input, update state, and emit any response.
		this.device.Transmit(data)
	}
}
```

Request/response behavior belongs inside this process or in components called by
it. This is the hardware application analogue of a software event loop.

### Test Components

Tests are written as Livt components marked with `@Test`:

```livt
namespace Example.Project.Tests

using Example.Project

@Test
component ByteReaderTest
{
	reader: ByteReader

	new()
	{
		this.reader = new ByteReader()
	}

	@Test
	fn ReadsByte()
	{
		var frame: byte[128]

		frame[14] = 0x08

		assert this.reader.GetByte(frame, 0) == 0x08
	}
}
```

Common conventions:

- `namespace` declarations carry the logical structure.
- Files may live directly under `src/` and `tests/` or in subdirectories. Keep
  each project's `livt.toml` paths and `[tests].components` list accurate.
- `component` defines state, constants, constructor wiring, and functions.
- `class` defines a named container for `public static fn` / `public static inline fn` helpers with no state or instance.
- `new()` constructs subcomponents or initializes local fields.
- `new[]()` appears in some verification projects for constructors that are
  explicitly context-free. Prefer the local project's existing style; the book
  examples use `new()`.
- `public fn` exposes a standalone public function.
- `inline fn` exposes a same-component combinatorial helper with zero dispatcher overhead.
- `public static inline fn` on a `class` exposes a cross-component combinatorial helper callable as `ClassName.Method(args)`.
- `override fn` implements a function declared in an interface or inherited from
  a parent component.
- Tests are `@Test component` with `@Test fn ...`.

## Data Types

### Primitive Types

| Keyword | Meaning | Typical use |
|---|---|---|
| `bool` | Two-valued condition: `true` or `false` | Decisions, function results, assertions |
| `logic` | Hardware logic value | Signals, ports, bit vectors |
| `byte` | Unsigned 8-bit value | Protocol data, buffers, encoded text |
| `int` | Signed 32-bit integer | Counters, loop variables, arithmetic |
| `uint` | Unsigned 32-bit integer | Non-negative counts and sizes |
| `string` | Text value | Simulation, constants, encoded byte data |
| `clock` | Clock signal | Sequential process context |
| `reset` | Reset signal | Sequential process context |

### `bool`

Use `bool` for decisions. Comparisons produce `bool`:

```livt
var enabled: bool = true
var small: bool = value < 10
```

Keep `bool` separate from `logic`. A `bool` answers a language-level question.
A `logic` value represents a hardware signal.

### `logic`

Use `logic` for hardware signals. Common literals: `0b0`, `0b1`, `0bU`, `0bX`,
`0bZ`.

`logic[N]` is an N-bit vector:

```livt
var nibble: logic[4] = 0b1010
var word: logic[32] = 0x0000002A
```

### `byte`

`byte` is an unsigned 8-bit value with range 0 through 255:

```livt
var zero: byte = 0x00
var letterA: byte = 0x41
```

Bytes are natural for packet data, UART payloads, memory contents, encoded text,
and protocol fields.

### `int` and `uint`

Use `int` for signed integer arithmetic and loop counters. Use `uint` when
negative values do not make sense:

```livt
var offset: int = -4
var length: uint = 1500
```

### `string`

Strings are text values, especially useful in tests, simulation reports, and
fixed text that should become byte data:

```livt
Simulation.Report("starting test")
```

A string can be encoded into bytes:

```livt
const GREETING: byte[] = "Hello".Encode()
```

Treat strings carefully in synthesizable code. Text is most often used at
compile time, in constants, or in simulation-only APIs.

### Fixed-Size Arrays

Hardware resources are statically allocated, so arrays usually have fixed sizes.
The size is part of the type:

```livt
var payload: byte[64]
var table: int[16]
var matrix: byte[2, 3]
```

Array literals:

```livt
var header: byte[4] = [0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF]
var offsets: int[3] = [0, 14, 34]
```

Multi-dimensional arrays use nested literals:

```livt
var matrix: byte[2, 3] = [
	[0x01, 0x02, 0x03],
	[0x04, 0x05, 0x06]
]
```

Indexing is zero-based:

```livt
var first = header[0]
header[1] = 0xAA
matrix[1, 2] = 0xFF
```

Function parameters can use unconstrained array types when the function should
accept multiple fixed lengths:

```livt
public fn GetFirst(values: int[]) int
{
	return values[0]
}

fn GetLength(bits: logic[]) int
{
	return bits.Length()
}
```

Use `.Length()` when a helper needs the caller-provided array length.

### Slices

Use Python-style `start:stop` slices to read or write a sub-range of a
`logic[N]` vector or byte array. `start` is inclusive and `stop` is exclusive,
so the result width is `stop - start`.

```livt
var word: logic[8] = 0b10110010
var lo: logic[4] = word[0:4]     // bits 3..0
var hi: logic[4] = word[4:8]     // bits 7..4
```

Variable bounds are supported when the slice width is inferable:

```livt
var i: int = offset as int
return word[i:i+4]
```

Slices can also be assignment targets on `logic[N]` fields:

```livt
this.word[4:8] = nibble
```

### Logic Vectors vs Array Dimensions

`logic[N]` is a vector, not a list of N separate Livt values. Initialize it with
a binary or hex literal:

```livt
var flags: logic[4] = 0b1010
```

Individual bits can be read or written with zero-based indexing:

```livt
var bit0: logic = flags[0]
this.status[3] = 0b1
```

Use bracket-list literals when the type is an array of elements:

```livt
var bytes: byte[3] = [0x10, 0x20, 0x30]
```

The distinction matters because it maps to different VHDL shapes.

### Type Inference

Livt can infer many local variable types from their initializer:

```livt
var value = 42
var ok = true
```

Use an explicit type when the width, signedness, or hardware shape matters:

```livt
var marker: byte = 0xFF
var flags: logic[8] = 0b00001111
```

For public fields, function parameters, constants, and interfaces, prefer
explicit types.

### Casts

The `as` operator converts a value at a specific point. Use it when a
conversion is intentional, especially when changing signedness or narrowing a
value:

```livt
var word: logic[32] = this.GetWord()
var high: byte = (word[24:32]) as byte
var sum: int = high as int
var low: byte = sum as byte
var bits: logic[8] = sum as logic[8]
```

Common verified conversions:

| Conversion | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `byte as int` / `byte as uint` | Unsigned widening, 0..255 |
| `logic[N] as uint` | Unsigned interpretation |
| `logic[N] as int` | Integer interpretation; use `uint` if the value is a hardware field that must be zero-extended |
| `logic[8] as byte` | Bit-for-bit 8-bit data reinterpretation |
| `byte as logic[8]` | Bit-for-bit 8-bit vector reinterpretation |
| `byte as logic[]` | Open-ended logic vector; width deduced from target, commonly 8 bits |
| `int as byte` / `uint as byte` | Low 8 bits; values outside 0..255 truncate/wrap |
| `int as logic[N]` | Signed two's-complement encoding into N bits |
| `uint as logic[N]` | Unsigned encoding into N bits |

Do not use `as` for `string` conversions. Keep `bool` separate from `logic`;
use comparisons for control flow (`x != 0`, `flag == 0b1`) rather than relying
on casts.

Widening conversions such as assigning `byte` to `int` or `uint` may be
accepted implicitly. Narrowing, reinterpretation, or meaning-changing
conversions should be explicit:

```livt
var b: byte = n as byte
if (b == (0 as byte))
{
	return true
}
```

Arithmetic operators require operands with compatible types. Cast each
sub-expression where the mix happens:

```livt
var sum: int = 0
var item: byte = 0x10
sum = sum + (item as int)
```

Parentheses around casts make mixed expressions easier to read, especially with
slices, masks, and arithmetic.

### Operators

Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`

Comparison (return `bool`): `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`

Logical (on `bool`): `&&`, `||`, `!`

Bitwise (on `logic`, `logic[N]`, and bytes where appropriate): `&`, `|`, `^`,
`~`

Shifts: `<<`, `>>`

Compound assignment forms are supported for common arithmetic and bitwise
operators:

```livt
result += value
result -= value
result &= mask
result |= flags
result ^= flags
result *= scale
result /= divisor
result %= modulus
```

Increment and decrement are supported as standalone statements and in
expressions:

```livt
index++
remaining--
var next = base + index++
```

When checking `logic`, compare it explicitly:

```livt
if (this.valid == 0b1)
{
	this.Accept()
}
```

## Control Flow

### Variables

Declare local variables with `var`:

```livt
var count: int = 0
var valid: bool = true
```

Variables are local to the function, process, or block where they are declared.
Fields belong to the component; variables belong to the current piece of code.

### Conditions

Conditions should be `bool` expressions:

```livt
if (count == 0)
{
	return true
}
else
{
	return false
}
```

### Guard Clauses

A guard clause handles a special case early and returns immediately:

```livt
public fn IsAsciiDigit(value: byte) bool
{
	if (value < 0x30)
	{
		return false
	}

	if (value > 0x39)
	{
		return false
	}

	return true
}
```

Guard clauses keep the main path of a function less nested.

### Branching

Livt does not have `else if`. Use `elif` for chained branches:

```livt
if (index == 0) {
	return 0x12
} elif (index == 1) {
	return 0x34
} else {
	return 0x00
}
```

In practice, independent guarded returns (as shown above) have proven more
reliable in functions. Use `elif` only where a chained branch is clearly
appropriate and the local project has confirmed it compiles correctly.

### `while` Loops

```livt
var index = 0

while (index < length)
{
	index++
}
```

Use `while` when the stopping condition is the clearest way to express the loop.

### `for` Loops

```livt
var sum = 0

for (var index = 0; index < 4; index++)
{
	sum = sum + values[index]
}
```

Use `for` when iterating over a fixed range, array, or known number of cycles.

### `foreach` Loops

Use `foreach` to iterate over arrays or iterator components:

```livt
public fn SumBytes(data: logic[4, 8]) logic[8]
{
	var result: logic[8] = 0b00000000
	foreach (var item in data)
	{
		result += item
	}
	return result
}
```

For iterator components, the component should provide the iterator contract used
by the base library (`Reset`, `HasNext`, and `Next` in current verification
examples). The loop owns the traversal for that cursor:

```livt
foreach (var item in this.iter)
{
	sum = sum + item
}
```

### `break` and `continue`

`break` exits a loop early. `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration.

Inside a `for` loop, `continue` advances through the increment step before the
next condition check. Inside a `while` loop, it jumps back to the condition.

### Process-Level `continue`

Processes run repeatedly. In a process body, `continue` has an additional
meaning: restart the process on the next cycle. This is useful for polling:

```livt
process Main()
{
	if (this.inputAvailable == false)
	{
		continue
	}

	this.HandleInput()
}
```

### State Blocks

Some hardware behavior is naturally multi-step. Livt uses `state` blocks to make
those steps explicit.

An anonymous state groups several statements into one step:

```livt
state {
	this.valid = 0b1
	this.data = 0x41
}
```

A named state can be used as a local jump target:

```livt
process Main()
{
	state Idle
	{
		if (this.start == 0b1)
		{
			goto Load
		}

		goto Idle
	}

	state Load
	{
		this.value = this.input
		goto Done
	}

	state Done
	{
		this.ready = 0b1
		goto Idle
	}
}
```

`goto` is deliberately local. It jumps only to named states in the current
process. It is not a general-purpose cross-function jump.

Use named states when the design has real sequencing over time: protocol
handshakes, multi-cycle algorithms, waiting for external input, staged reads or
writes.

### Cycle Cost and `state` as a Performance Tool

In a **sequential process or function**, every Livt statement compiles to its
own FSM state — one clock cycle per statement. This default is safe and
predictable, but can be slow for compute-heavy code.

A `state {}` block groups all of its statements into a **single** FSM state,
executing them all in the same clock cycle:

```livt
// Without state {}: 4 separate clock cycles
this.a = x ^ y
this.b = x & y
this.c = this.a ^ this.b
this.out = this.c

// With state {}: all 4 assignments in one clock cycle
state {
	this.a = x ^ y
	this.b = x & y
	this.c = this.a ^ this.b
	this.out = this.c
}
```

This is the primary tool for reducing latency in performance-critical functions.
For example, an AES round that processes 16 bytes sequentially takes 16+ cycles;
wrapping all 16 byte operations in a single `state {}` reduces that to 1 cycle
at the cost of a larger combinational path.

### Combinational Processes and Zero-Latency Outputs

A **combinational process** (`process Name[]()`) contains no FSM states at all.
All statements in its body are evaluated combinationally — output updates
instantly when inputs change, with no clock cycles consumed:

```livt
process ComputeTag[]()
{
	this.tag = this.a ^ this.b ^ this.c
}
```

This is useful for derived outputs that are pure functions of stored fields.
Combining a combinational process with `state {}` in sequential functions is
the main strategy for achieving high-throughput designs in Livt.

### Summary: Latency Reduction Strategies

| Approach | Effect |
|---|---|
| Default (no `state {}`) | One clock cycle per statement |
| `state { stmt1; stmt2; ... }` | All statements in one cycle (wider combinational path) |
| `process Name[]()` | Zero-latency combinational output |
| Named states + `goto` | Explicit multi-cycle FSM with reuse of states |

For the crypto components in this project, wrapping the per-byte operations
inside each round into a single `state {}` block would reduce AES EncryptBlock
from ~50,000 cycles to roughly 10–20 cycles (one state per round), at the cost
of a more complex combinational path that may reduce Fmax.

## Interfaces And Inheritance

### Defining an Interface

Interfaces declare contracts without implementation. They can contain function
signatures, constants, and fields:

```livt
interface IMemory
{
	fn Read(address: logic[16]) logic[8]
	fn Write(address: logic[16], data: logic[8])
}
```

### Implementing an Interface

Use `:` to implement an interface. Each contract function must use `override fn`,
not `public fn`:

```livt
component SimpleRam : IMemory
{
	storage: byte[65536]

	override fn Read(address: logic[16]) logic[8]
	{
		return this.storage[address]
	}

	override fn Write(address: logic[16], data: logic[8])
	{
		this.storage[address] = data
	}
}
```

The `override` keyword is required whenever a function fulfils an interface
contract or overrides an inherited function. Using `public fn` for an interface
function is incorrect and will not satisfy the contract.

### Interface Fields (Automatic Contract Fields)

Interfaces may declare fields. When a component implements such an interface,
the field is automatically materialized on the component — no redeclaration is
needed or allowed:

```livt
interface ICounter
{
	value: logic[8]
	fn Increment()
	fn Reset()
}

component UpCounter : ICounter
{
	// 'value' is provided automatically — do NOT redeclare it.

	override fn Increment() { this.value = this.value + 1 }
	override fn Reset()     { this.value = 0 }
}
```

Redeclaring an interface field in the implementing component is a compiler error.

### Interface Constants In Scope

Constants declared in an interface are automatically in scope inside the bodies
of functions in any implementing component:

```livt
interface IBus
{
	const DATA_WIDTH: int = 32
	fn Read() logic[DATA_WIDTH]
}

component MyBus : IBus
{
	override fn Read() logic[DATA_WIDTH]
	{
		// DATA_WIDTH is in scope here without qualification.
		return 0
	}
}
```

### Interface Inheritance

Interfaces can extend other interfaces with `:`. An implementing component must
provide `override fn` for all functions in the entire chain:

```livt
interface IBase    { fn GetBase() int }
interface IDerived : IBase { fn GetDerived() int }

component MyComponent : IDerived
{
	override fn GetBase()    int { return 1 }
	override fn GetDerived() int { return 2 }
}
```

### Multiple Interfaces

A component can implement more than one interface by listing them
comma-separated:

```livt
component Combo : IFoo, IBar
{
	override fn GetFoo() int { return 1 }
	override fn GetBar() int { return 2 }
}
```

If two implemented interfaces declare the same function name, one `override fn`
body satisfies both.

### Component Inheritance

One component can extend another with `:`. The child component inherits all
`public fn` declarations from the parent and can call them directly:

```livt
component Animal
{
	public fn GetKind() int { return 1 }
}

component Dog : Animal
{
	public fn GetName() int { return 2 }
	// GetKind() is inherited and callable on Dog instances.
}
```

A child may also override a parent function using `override fn`. Chain
inheritance (`Puppy : Dog : Animal`) is supported.

### Signal Bundles (Interface as Signal Group)

Interfaces are also useful for grouping signals:

```livt
interface IByteStream
{
	valid: in logic
	ready: out logic
	data: in byte
}
```

This keeps protocol signals together. Instead of passing `valid`, `ready`, and
`data` through every constructor separately, a component can accept one stream
interface:

```livt
component StreamConsumer
{
	stream: IByteStream

	new(stream: IByteStream)
	{
		this.stream = stream
	}
}
```

### Interface Direction and `flip`

Declare signal interfaces from one consistent point of view (usually the
consumer). A producer is on the opposite side. Use `flip` when a component
should drive the fields that the consumer normally receives:

```livt
component StreamProducer
{
	stream: IByteStream

	new(stream: flip IByteStream)
	{
		this.stream = stream
	}

	process Produce[]()
	{
		this.stream.valid = 0b1
		this.stream.data = 0x41
	}
}
```

`flip IByteStream` reverses the field directions for this constructor binding.

### Pass-Through Wiring

A parent component can receive an interface and forward it to a subcomponent:

```livt
component StreamStage
{
	consumer: StreamConsumer

	new(stream: IByteStream)
	{
		this.consumer = new StreamConsumer(stream)
	}
}
```

### Test Doubles

Interfaces make tests easier. A test can provide a small implementation of an
interface instead of instantiating a full subsystem:

```livt
component TestByteSource : IByteSource
{
	override fn HasData() bool { return true }
	override fn Read() byte    { return 0x42 }
}
```

### Hierarchy vs Composition

Use hierarchy (interfaces + inheritance) when you want substitutability: several
components can stand in for the same role, and callers should not need to know
which implementation they receive.

Use composition (owning subcomponents) when you want ownership and structure:
one component contains and coordinates other components. Each subcomponent can
be tested independently.

In real Livt systems, both approaches are valid and often appear together.

## Build And Test

Normal test command:

```sh
livt test
```

Compile without running simulations:

```sh
livt build
```

Run a single configured test component or test method:

```sh
livt test -r MyComponentTest
livt test -r MyComponentTest:TestSomething
```

Dependency sync, if needed:

```sh
livt sync
```

Some environments may print Log4j errors because the Livt CLI tries to write a
log file outside the workspace, for example:

```text
/home/.../.livt/logs/livt.log (Read-only file system)
```

Treat this as noise only if the command exits successfully.

Useful CLI commands:

- `livt new Name`: create a new project directory.
- `livt init`: initialize a project in the current directory.
- `livt build`: parse, type-check, and generate VHDL.
- `livt test`: build and run configured test components using GHDL.
- `livt test -r Component[:Method]`: run a filtered test.
- `livt sync`: install dependencies into `.livt/deps/`.
- `livt add`, `livt remove`, `livt lock`: manage dependencies.
- `livt vendor`: create vendor-tool integration files.

When adding new source or test files, incremental generation may miss new
entities. A useful forced-regeneration pattern is:

```sh
rm -rf out .livt/src.json .livt/ghdl
livt test
```

Avoid `livt clean` in projects with synced dependencies unless you know how it
behaves for that project. In at least one project it removed `.livt/deps`, which
then required `livt sync`.

## Practical Livt Style

### Naming

- **Namespaces**: `PascalCase`, two or three segments. E.g. `Livt.Dsp`,
  `Livt.App`.
- **Components/Interfaces**: `PascalCase` nouns. Interfaces start with `I`.
  E.g. `ButterflyUnit`, `IMemory`.
- **Functions**: `PascalCase`. `Get` prefix for pure reads, imperative verb for
  side-effecting. E.g. `GetByte`, `Reset`, `LoadContent`.
- **Fields**: `camelCase`. E.g. `rxByteIndex`, `headerLength`.
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`. E.g. `OFFSET`, `MAX_BUFFER_SIZE`.
- **Parameters**: `camelCase`. E.g. `index`, `frame`.

### Component Structure

- **Single responsibility**: Each component should have one clear purpose.
- **Layer separation**: Separate reusable protocol code from application-specific
  code. Keep protocol parsers, builders, and checksums in a shared library
  namespace. Keep application-specific logic in the application namespace.
- **Ownership**: Each component should own its own subcomponents. The top-level
  application component is the composition root.
- **Size**: Keep components small enough to read in one sitting (roughly under
  200 lines). A function over ~50 lines should usually be split.

### Fields

- Default to private. Add `public` only when a caller genuinely needs access.
- Fields are initialized to their zero values by default.
- Use stored fields (no direction) for internal state. Use signal fields
  (`in`/`out`) for hardware ports.

### Functions

- Keep functions as pure as possible. Pure functions are easier to test and
  generate simpler VHDL.
- Use guard clauses to return early for special cases.
- Direct computed arguments are supported, including calls such as
  `this.store.GetByte(index - 10)`. Still bind intermediate expressions to
  local `var`s when that improves readability or when a project-specific
  compiler note calls for it.
- For nested subcomponent-call arguments, bind the inner call to a local `var`
  first:

```livt
var offset = this.helper.GetOffset()
return this.checker.IsGood(a, offset)
```

- For pure combinatorial helpers that need no component state, prefer
  `inline fn` inside the calling component (zero overhead, no instance
  needed) or `public static inline fn` on a `class` (shareable across
  components).
- `class` static methods are supported and are the preferred shape for
  stateless shared helpers. Do not put fields or array constants in a class;
  classes are function containers only.

```livt
// Compact
return localMac[index - 6]

// Easier to debug and comment
var macIndex = index - 6
return localMac[macIndex]
```

### Constructors

- Constructors should wire subcomponents and record input bindings. They should
  not contain complex logic.
- Constructor method calls are supported and run as part of the generated
  startup sequence before ordinary process behavior. Use them for small,
  deterministic setup.
- For computed initialization that loops over RAM, decodes data, or does
  substantial work, prefer an explicit public startup function called from a
  process or test.

### Startup Functions

Initialization that requires computation (pre-loading RAM, computing a checksum
over a static buffer) is clearer and easier to test as an explicit startup
function. Call it from a process with an `initialized: bool` guard:

```livt
process Main()
{
	if (!this.initialized)
	{
		this.LoadContent()
		this.initialized = true
	}

	// ... normal work
}
```

Or call the initialization method at the start of `@Test fn` bodies.

## Assertions

Use explicit boolean comparisons:

```livt
assert component.IsReady() == true
assert component.IsError() == false
```

Avoid bare boolean assertions:

```livt
assert component.IsReady()
```

Some compiler versions have generated invalid VHDL for bare boolean assertions.

## Arrays And Helpers

Array parameters can be read, forwarded, and mutated. Use `out` when a function
is meant to fill a caller-provided array:

```livt
public fn FillFrame(frame: out byte[64])
{
	frame[0] = 0xFF
	frame[1] = 0xFE
}
```

For test fixtures, setting up short arrays inline is often the most readable
choice:

```livt
var frame: byte[128]
frame[12] = 0x08
frame[13] = 0x00
```

Helper functions that mutate an array parameter are also supported, including
private helpers that commit changes back to a component field:

```livt
fn Fill(frame: byte[128])
{
	frame[12] = 0x08
}
```

## Component Call Boundaries

Direct computed arguments to same-component and subcomponent calls are supported:

```livt
return this.child.GetByte(index - OFFSET)
```

For nested subcomponent calls used as arguments, bind the inner result first:

```livt
var payloadOffset = this.header.GetPayloadOffset()
return this.parser.Match(frame, payloadOffset)
```

For packet/frame builders, explicit index mapping can still be the clearest
style when the mapping itself is the behavior under test:

```livt
if (index == 54) {
	return this.payload.GetByte(0)
}

if (index == 55) {
	return this.payload.GetByte(1)
}
```

If you hit a compiler or simulation issue, record the exact pattern and
workaround in `COMPILER.md`.

## Types And Literals

Common primitive-like types used in examples:

- `bool`
- `int`
- `uint`
- `byte`
- `logic`
- `logic[8]`
- fixed arrays such as `byte[64]`, `byte[128]`

Hex and binary literals are accepted in typed contexts:

```livt
var b: byte = 0x41
var flags: logic[8] = 0b10101010
var n: int = 0xFF
```

Use explicit casts when a literal's target type would otherwise be ambiguous or
when comparing against a strongly typed value:

```livt
if (b == (255 as byte))
{
	return true
}
```

## Strings And Encoded Bytes

Double-quoted string literals can be converted to byte arrays with `.Encode()`,
which is useful for readable test data and static payloads:

```livt
var content = "Hello, World!".Encode()
```

Common escape sequences are supported in encoded strings:

```livt
var crlf = "\r\n".Encode()     // 0x0D, 0x0A
var tab = "\t".Encode()        // 0x09
```

Use `.Length()` on encoded byte arrays when the size matters:

```livt
var bytes = "OK".Encode()
var len = bytes.Length()
```

## Dependencies

Dependencies appear in `livt.toml`, for example:

```toml
[dependencies]
Ram="1.0.0"
```

Synced dependencies live under `.livt/deps/`. Inspect their source before using
them; dependency APIs are often small and explicit.

## Base Library

The Livt base library provides common types, annotations, and utilities:

- **Core types**: `bool`, `byte`, `int`, `logic`, `string`, `clock`, `reset`
- **Annotations**: `@Test` on components and functions
- **Simulation utilities**: `Simulation.Report(...)` for test output and
  `Simulation.Wait(...)` for simulation time in tests
- **String encoding**: `.Encode()` to convert strings to byte arrays
- **Context**: `this.context.clk` / `this.context.rst` for clocked processes

Keep simulation helpers in tests. Use the base library for universal building
blocks; use packages for domain-specific functionality.

Key base library namespaces include:

- `Livt.Bits`: bit manipulation helpers such as extract, insert, count ones,
  parity, reverse, rotate, zero/sign extend
- `Livt.Ascii`: ASCII classification and conversion helpers
- `Livt.Convert`: explicit clamped, wrapping, checked, or truncating conversions
- `Livt.Diagnostics`: test and simulation reporting helpers
- `Livt.String`: string helpers for simulation and tests
- `Livt.Array`: fixed-size array helpers

## Packages and Reuse

A package is the delivery and maintenance unit around reusable Livt code. A good
package contains a coherent capability: a protocol interface and helpers, a
reusable component, a family of related components, or a vendor wrapper.

A package should provide:

- clear public API (components, interfaces, constants)
- tests that verify the public contract
- versioning (signal direction, constructor, timing, or reset changes are
  breaking)
- documentation (what it provides, how to instantiate, timing assumptions)

Extract a package when at least two projects need the same code, the interface
is stable, and the tests are strong enough to protect users.

## Vendor Integration

Livt generates VHDL so designs can enter existing FPGA and ASIC toolchains. The
normal flow is: write Livt source → build → review generated VHDL → run
simulation → hand to vendor flow for synthesis/implementation.

Keep synthesizable design code separate from test and simulation code. The
top-level component is the bridge to the vendor project — keep its constructor
clear and hardware-facing:

```livt
component Top
{
	app: AppCore

	new(clk: clock, rst: reset, rx: in logic, tx: out logic)
	{
		this.context.clk = clk
		this.context.rst = rst
		this.app = new AppCore(rx, tx)
	}
}
```

Wrap vendor-specific primitives (PLLs, block RAMs, transceivers, IO buffers)
behind stable Livt interfaces. Keep constraints (clock definitions, pin
assignments, IO standards) versioned with the project.

Before integrating into a vendor project, inspect generated ports: Are directions
correct? Are clock/reset ports connected as expected? Do interface fields expand
into expected VHDL records or ports?

## Continuous Integration

A useful Livt CI pipeline answers: Does the project build? Do all tests pass?
Did generated VHDL change unexpectedly?

Start with `livt build` and `livt test` on every change. Add heavier vendor jobs
(synthesis, implementation, timing reports) on a schedule or before release.

Archive generated VHDL as a build artifact. Keep tests deterministic. Group tests
by cost: fast unit tests for every change, integration simulations for merge
requests, vendor implementation for release gates.

## Migration to Livt

Migration does not need to be a rewrite. The safest path is gradual:

1. Read the existing design first — understand top-level ports, clocks, resets,
   state, protocol boundaries, and vendor primitives.
2. Choose small, well-tested migration targets: byte classifiers, packet header
   parsers, register blocks, simple FIFOs, protocol adapters.
3. Wrap existing VHDL/Verilog behind a Livt interface. New code uses the Livt
   contract while old code remains in place.
4. Replace boilerplate first: duplicated constants, repeated signal bundles,
   hand-written testbench setup, protocol field extraction.
5. Preserve behavior — keep original testbenches passing, write equivalent Livt
   tests, inspect generated VHDL.

## Testing Strategy

Add tests immediately after each small component:

1. constants/offset helpers
2. parser field extraction
3. classifier predicates
4. builder byte emission
5. checksum or arithmetic helpers
6. small application composition
7. end-to-end byte-array scenarios
8. platform adapters last

Prefer several small tests over one monolithic integration test. When a test
fails due to compiler/VHDL generation rather than logic, reduce the pattern and
document it.

### Testing Stateful Components

Stateful components need tests that perform actions in order:

```livt
@Test
fn CountsAcceptedPackets()
{
	this.stats.Accept()
	this.stats.Accept()

	assert this.stats.acceptedCount == 2
}
```

### Testing Processes

Processes may need time to pass. Use states to give the design cycles:

```livt
@Test
fn UpdatesAfterCycles()
{
	state {}
	state {}

	assert this.counter.count == 2
}
```

For tests and simulation-only components, `Simulation.Wait(n)` is also
available when a time-based wait is clearer than spelling out many empty states:

```livt
@Test
fn CompletesAfterStartup()
{
	Simulation.Wait(100)
	assert this.component.IsDone() == true
}
```

## Recommended Project-Specific Files

For each Livt example project, use:

- `CONTEXT.md`: this reusable Livt agent guide.
- `README.md` or `AGENTS.md`: project-specific goal, scope, architecture,
  current status, next steps, and local quirks.
- `COMPILER.md`: compiler/generation issues found in that project.
- `README.md`: human-facing project overview and run instructions.

Future prompt pattern:

```text
Please read CONTEXT.md and the project README first, then continue the project.
```
